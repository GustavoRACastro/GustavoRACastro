- ðŸ“„ About Me

  Mechanical Engineer since 2021, I have worked with Projects and Maintenance for around 7 years, working with some of the best technologies avaiable, like AutoCAD, SolidWorks, SAP, Totvs and others. Working with maintenance management, I've started to be interested on working with Power Bi, and I had this opportunity, to develop the dashboards we used on Excel, replicating them. So It was a great experience, where I was able to learn about a new world, not only on Power BI, but into Data Analysis, the place where raw info turn into business decisions, where thinking is as important as acting, and I found where I feel more confortable to work on.

  Since this I've been dedicating my time to learn about Data Science, I the last months I'm very engaged on learning SQL and Python, to improve my abilities on conding and improve my analysis.
